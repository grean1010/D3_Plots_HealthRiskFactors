          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Explore the graphic above to see the relationship between health risks, age and income.  Select factors along 
             axis to see the interplay between these variables.  At first glance, it seems that there are many important 
             relationships here.  But are there?
          </p>

          <p>The short answer is yes... and no... because nothing is that easy and there are no short answers.</p>

          <p>Let's take the simplest of the x-axis variables-- Age.  Click through the y-axis values to explore the relationship 
              between a state's median age and the percentage of the population with various health risks.  
              <ul>
                 <li><b>Percent Without Health Care.  </b>At first glance, there is not much correlation between median age 
                   in a state and the percentage of the population without healthcare.  But look closer and see that there is a cluster of 
                   higher rates of non-insurance in states with younger populations. This is likely the result of Medicare being available
                   to those over 65.  It's possible that states with large numbers of retirees are masking large portions of younger, uninsured 
                   people. </li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who Smoke.  </b>Here we see that there is a trend.  Smoking is less prevalent in states with a lower median 
                   age.  This is consistent with public health efforts over the past several decades to prevent youth smoking. </li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who are Obese.  </b>There does not appear to be any correlation between a state's median age and the 
                   percent of the population who are obese. </li>
              </ul>   
           </p>
           <p>Now consider median income.  Select median income on the x-axis and click through the y-axis values to explore the relationship 
              between a state's median income and the percentage of the population with various health risks.  
              <ul>
                 <li><b>Percent Without Health Care.  </b>Not surprisingly, there is a strong correlation between median income and the 
                   percentage of the population without health care.  Health care is expensive and most Americans are insured through their 
                   employer.  It makes sense that those with better employment would have more money and be more likely to have health insurance. </li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who Smoke.  </b>There is a much stronger correlation between a state's median income and its smoking rate. Smoking 
                   cessation can be an expensive, time-consuming venture. More money means more resources available for those who want to quit. 
                   Over a large population, this makes a difference in the ability to sucessfully quit smoking.</li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who are Obese.  </b>At first this relationship seems counter-intuitive.  People with less money are far more likely
                   to be obese. One would think that having no money means having no food. However, the system of food supply in the United States is 
                   one of extreme plenty for calories and extreme dearth for nutrition.  Healthy food is more expensive than cheap, calorie-dense junk 
                   foods. Additionally, much like smoking cessation, weight loss programs are both costly and time-consuming. This puts it out of reach 
                   of people without a certain income.  Both of those factors together contribute to soaring obesity rates among the 
                   nation's poor. </li>
              </ul>   
           </p>
           <p>Finally, consider poverty rates.  Select poverty on the x-axis and click through the y-axis values to explore the relationship 
              between a state's poverty rate and the percentage of the population with various health risks.  The relationships and correlations 
              are nearly identical to those related to income.  In fact, some of the relationships are more stark because poverty rates reflect 
              a family's income relative to the local economic conditions.  
              <ul>
                 <li><b>Percent Without Health Care.  </b>While we expect to see a similar relationship between poverty and health care access, it 
                  is surprising to note that there are still very percentages of the population without healthcare in some of the poorest states. 
                  Normally Medicaid would enroll the poorest in a state, but some states block access or simply do not have the funds to enroll all 
                  of their poor. </li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who Smoke.  </b>This relationship is nearly identical to the median income relationship to smoking rates. It's worth 
                  noting that smoking can often be an outlet or emotional crutch for people living in desperate conditions. It's also worth noting 
                  that the price of smoking only adds to the overal economic crunch a family is facing.</li>
                 <li><b>Percent Who are Obese.  </b>Again we see an even more stark relationship between poverty and obesity as we saw with income. </li>
              </ul>   
           </p>
           <p>
             The real story here is that poverty kills.  The health effects of living under the constant stress of poverty are well-documented.  The 
             fact that poverty persists and feeds itself is equally well-known. People with limited resources will stick to a vice such as smoking as 
             one of their only releases. Lack of affordable, nutritious food will keep them obese. Decades of living this way takes a heavy toll on the 
             body and spririt. Eventually, people live much sicker lives and die much sooner than they should. In the mean time they cost the health care 
             system far more money and resources than they would have had the country invested in their health and well-being from a young age.
